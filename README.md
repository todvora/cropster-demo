# Backend Developer Challenge Part 1

## Initial project structure
Generated by [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/)

## Database
For the sake of simplicity and zero-configuration runs, the demo runs on H2 database. It uses JPA/Hibernate
anyway, so there are no database specific queries anyway, it would run the same on mysql or postgresql.

## Version control 
Versioned in git, hosted on github.

## Tests
There are two test classes, the `FacilityManagementTest` is just a usual unit test used during
the development phase. The `RoastingDemo` is described lower.

## Demo - Roast Simulator
The demo / simulator is also implemented as a spring boot test in the `RoastingDemoTest.java` class.  
It's easy to run and, maybe more important, it contains some assertions, to verify that the simulator does make sense 
and generates valid data and database entries. Without assertions, it would be just dummy text output 
without any control over the correctness of the process.

You can run the simulator either from your IDE or by calling `

```
mvn test
```

on the command line (both test classes will run automatically, the unit test and the simulator itself). 

The simulator logs relevant information and contains basic checks like 

* Roasting simulator used all coffee and the weight before roasting start equals sum of all RoastingProcess entries
* The overall weight loss is in 8-15% range as required
* Every roasting took between 5 and 15 minutes
